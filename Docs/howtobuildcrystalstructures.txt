Building Crystal Structures

Building crystal structures fairly straigth forward. There are two steps: 
First step you need to prepare a unitcell file which contains definition of conventional unit cell of the desired material.
Format of this file is similar to VASP or ABINIT's POSCAR file:

Firs line defines the number of atoms in the unit cell. Second line is a scaling factor which modifies lattice constant. Default value is 1.0. Following three lines define lattice constants (i.e. h-matrix) of the unit cell. The unit is in Angstroms.
Next line defines the format for the positions of atoms in the unit cell. Direct corresponds to fractional coordinates. Currently only fractional coordinates are supported. The conversion between fractional and cartesian is:

R_c= h * R_f 

Here h stands for h-matrix and R_f and R_c are fractional and cartesian coordinates.

Following lines define positions of atoms. First column is the atom type. Columns 2 to 5 are fractional coordinates. 6th column is again atom type. 7th and 8th columns are element symbol and mass respectively. Here atom type definition is for LAMMPS only. LAMMPS labels atoms with type indices defined at the input script. For example if you are running a simulation which contains Mo , O, S atoms you may label these three elements as 1,2,3 in the force field definition. Then you need to set same labels in your unit cell file in order to generate compatible format.
